# University of Helsinki: Java Programming I (Completed)
**Score: 99% / 100%**

This repository contains my solutions to the Mooc.fi Java Programming I. This journey represents over 70 hours of coding, and a deep dive into the fundamentals of software engineering.

## 🏆 Featured Projects
* **[Recipe Search Engine](./part07/Part07_06.RecipeSearch)**: Capstone project focusing on File I/O and object-oriented architecture.

## 💡 Major "Aha!" Moments & Growth
Through the 7 parts of this course, I learnt:

1. **The Blueprint vs. The House:** Understanding that a **Class** is just a blueprint, and **Objects** are the actual houses. And an object can contain other objects, which can contain more objects!
2. **Naming is Logic:** Naming a variable `list` vs. `recipes` is about clarity. Good names act as documentation and prevent logic errors before they happen.
3. **The Power of "Dry" Code:** Extract repeated loops into a method maing the code shorter and much easier to debug.
4. **Learning to Love the Error:** Treating errors as helpful roadmaps. I now spend more time reading the stack trace than guessing where the bug is.

## 🛠 Skills Acquired
* Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Methods, Constructors)
* Data Structures (ArrayLists, Strings, Primitive types)
* File Handling & Parsing
* Unit Testing & Test-Driven Development (TMC)
